# Linux Virtualization: Easy Guide for Absolute Beginners

Welcome! This guide is for **absolute beginners**. Why am I making this? I hope that you will **not make the same mistake as I did** ‚Äî trying to install Linux on your own machine as a total beginner‚Ä¶ and breaking things.

If you are curious like me, you might accidentally **delete core metadata** or do something that renders your entire personal computer unable to operate. üòÖ

This is where **virtual machines (VMs)** come in:

- You can set one up just to **break it**  
- Do all the things you‚Äôve always wanted to try  
- Be impulsive, irresponsible, and experiment freely

I was intimidated by the Linux community for too long ‚Äî **everyone starts somewhere!**

## üöÄ Required Software

### ‚úÖ Virtualization Software

This tutorial is based on **VirtualBox**, but **VMware** works well too. Use whichever one you prefer.

- [Download VirtualBox](https://www.oracle.com/virtualization/technologies/vm/downloads/virtualbox-downloads.html)  
- [Download VMware Workstation Player or Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion)

### ‚úÖ ISO Files

For this tutorial, we‚Äôll be setting up virtual machines for:

- **Debian**  
- **Arch Linux**  
- **Kali Linux**

You can find 1‚Äì3 ISO files here:  
üîó [https://www.linuxlookup.com/linux_iso](https://www.linuxlookup.com/linux_iso)

## üåÄ Arch Linux via Torrent

- [Arch Linux Download Page](https://archlinux.org/download/)  
- Download the **torrent file** ‚Äî it helps seed the file, which is a nice thing to do for the community. (Yes, Linux users can be pretentious, but you wouldn‚Äôt be here if you didn‚Äôt want to be one of us üòé)

If you don‚Äôt already have a torrent client, I recommend **qBittorrent**, a free and open-source torrent agent.

- [Download qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download)  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Tip:** Don‚Äôt confuse this with the original BitTorrent client ‚Äî they are different!

## üõ°Ô∏è Kali Linux for Virtual Machines

Kali provides **specialized ISO images for virtual machines**, making setup easy.

- Go to [Kali VM downloads](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines)  
- Click on **VirtualBox**, or choose your preferred alternative

## Debian lightweight

Debian has several options but I went with the lightweight version. I have good internet and as long as you are not offline you should choose this one too.

- Go to [Debian's downloads page](https://www.debian.org/distrib/)

- Choose Debian small image

This is confusing or exciting as you may want to actually think about your computers architecture now. If you click on this ![more info](images/prereqs/debian_moreinfo)

it will take you here: https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/ for the option of extra reading if you are curious. 

However you should most likely be ok selecting [amd64](screenshots/debian_amd64)
