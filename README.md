# Linux Virtualization: Easy Guide for Absolute Beginners





This guide is for absolute beginners. Why am I making this? I hope that you will not make the same mistakes as I did, like trying to install Linux on your own machine as a total beginner‚Ä¶ and breaking things.
If you are curious like me, you might break something important, like deleting core meta data, rendering you entire personal computer unable to operate.

This is where **virtual machines (VMs)** come in:

You can set one up, just to break it! You can do the things you have always wanted to! You can be impulsive, irresponsible, and just try things!
I was intimidated by the Linux community for too long (they can be extremely pretentious. Try not to let it get to you).

## üöÄ Required Software

### ‚úÖ Virtualization Software

This tutorial is based on **VirtualBox**, but **VMware** works well too. Use whichever one you prefer.

- [Download VirtualBox](https://www.oracle.com/virtualization/technologies/vm/downloads/virtualbox-downloads.html)  
- [Download VMware Workstation Player or Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion)

### ‚úÖ ISO Files

For this tutorial, we‚Äôll be setting up virtual machines for:

- **Debian**  
- **Arch Linux**  
- **Kali Linux**

You can find 1‚Äì3 ISO files here:  
üîó [https://www.linuxlookup.com/linux_iso](https://www.linuxlookup.com/linux_iso)

## üåÄ Arch Linux via Torrent

- [Arch Linux Download Page](https://archlinux.org/download/)  
- Download the **torrent file**. This helps seed the file and is a nice thing to do for the community (I know Linux users are pretentious, but you would not be here if you did not want to be one of us.)

If you don‚Äôt already have a torrent client, I recommend **qBittorrent**, a free and open-source torrent agent.

- [Download qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download)  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Tip:** Don‚Äôt confuse this with the original BitTorrent client.

## üõ°Ô∏è Kali Linux for Virtual Machines

Kali provides **specialized ISO images for virtual machines**, making setup easy.

- Go to [Kali VM downloads](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines)  
- Click on **VirtualBox**, or choose your preferred alternative

## Debian lightweight

Debian has several options but I went with the lightweight version. I have good internet and as long as you are not offline you should choose this one too.

- Go to [Debian's downloads page](https://www.debian.org/distrib/)

- Choose Debian small image

This is confusing or exciting as you may want to actually think about your computers architecture now. If you click on this ![more info](images/prereqs/debian_moreinfo)

it will take you here: https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/ for the option of extra reading if you are curious. 

However you should most likely be ok selecting [amd64](screenshots/debian_amd64)
