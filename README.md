# Linux Virtualization: Easy Guide for Absolute Beginners

Welcome! This guide is for **complete beginners** who want to explore Linux without risking their main system. I'm writing this because, when I first got curious about Linux, I made the mistake of installing it directly on my machine without understanding what I was doing — and I broke things.

If you're curious like I was, **virtual machines** are your safe sandbox. With a VM, you can:
- Experiment freely
- Break things without consequences
- Learn by doing
- Be impulsive, irresponsible, and curious — safely!

Everyone starts somewhere. I hope this helps you get going.

## 🚀 What You’ll Need

### ✅ Virtualization Software
This tutorial uses **VirtualBox**, but **VMware** or any hypervisor you're comfortable with will work.

- [Download VirtualBox](https://www.oracle.com/virtualization/technologies/vm/downloads/virtualbox-downloads.html)
- [Download VMware Workstation Player or Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion)

### ✅ ISO Files
We’ll install the following Linux distributions inside virtual machines:
- [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/download/)
- [Debian](https://www.debian.org/distrib/)
- [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/)

You can browse more ISOs here:

## 🌀 Arch Linux via Torrent

Arch is minimalist and gives you full control, but it’s not beginner-friendly. That’s okay — we're here to experiment!

- Head to [Arch’s download page](https://archlinux.org/download/)
- Download the **torrent file** (helps the community by seeding!)

If you need a torrent client, I recommend [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download) — it's free, open-source, and not ad-ridden like BitTorrent.

> ✅ **Tip:** Don’t confuse qBittorrent with the original BitTorrent client. They are different!

## 🛡️ Kali Linux for Virtual Machines

Kali provides pre-built ISOs specifically optimized for VMs.

- Go to [Kali’s virtual machine downloads](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines)
- Choose **VirtualBox**, **VMware**, or another option depending on your hypervisor

## Debian lightweight

Debian has several options but I went with the lightweight version. I have good internet and as long as you are not offline you should choose this one too.

- Go to [Debian's downloads page](https://www.debian.org/distrib/)
- Choose Debian small image

This is confusing or exciting as you may want to actually think about your computers architecture now. If you click on this ![more info](screenshots/debian_moreinfo)
it will take you here: https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/ for the option of extra reading if you are curious. 
However you should most likely be ok selecting [amd64](screenshots/debian_amd64)
