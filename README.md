# linux-virtualization-easy-guide
This guide is for absolute beginners. Why am I making this? I hope that you will not make the same mistake as I did, and obtain Linux on your own machine as a total beginner.....
If you are curious like me, you might break something important, like deleting core meta data, rendering you entire personal computer unable to operate.

This is where virtual machines come in. 
You can set one up, just to break it! You can do the things you have always wanted to! You can be impulsive, irresponsible, and just try things!
I was intimidated by the Linux community for too long. Everyone starts somewhere!

## required software

### virtualization software:
the tutorial will be written based on virtualbox, but VMware is good as well. of course feel free to use one of your choosing.
--Virtualbox; download link: https://www.oracle.com/virtualization/technologies/vm/downloads/virtualbox-downloads.html
--VMware; download link: https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion
### 1 to 3 ISO files:
[https://www.linuxlookup.com/linux_iso](https://www.linuxlookup.com/linux_iso)
For this tutorial, I will be setting up a machine for Debian, Arch, and Kali.

### Arch torrent download
--https://archlinux.org/download/
Download the torrent file. This helps seed the file and is a nice thing to do for the community (I know Linux users are pretentious, but you would not be here if you did not want to be one of us.)

If you do not already have a torrent client, here is qbittorrent, a free and open source torrent agent. Do not confuse this with BitTorrent:
